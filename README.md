# CRBl_ Studio Games (CSG)

CSG is a server that allows you to **play** multiplayer (mini-)games with
**friends**. You can create a room, invite your friends, select the mini-games
you want and play.

## Status

CSG is in a very early stage and **not** yet usable. Star the repository if you
want to come back later and check on the development status.

## Documentation

A documentation book can be found right
[here](https://crbl-studio.github.io/games/).
