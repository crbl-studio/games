# Introduction

This is an introduction chapter which briefly explains the layout of this book.
This book contains two points of focus.

## Part one

This part should give an extensive description of the project, describe all of
its features and how the project should look like, in its final state. It
should describe the project from the **user's** perspective, to give a clear
understanding of the goal of this project. It is important to read this part if
you want to work on the project and understand where the project is going.

## Part two

This part should give a clear understanding of the project's architecture. It
should describe the project from the **developer's** perspective, and should
help developers understand how the project works under the hood.

## Layout

In part two, every component of the project is split under multiple
subchapters. Each component should have a description subchapter, describing
what it is, what it is used for, etc. Components containing an API should have
an API subchapter, describing all of its endpoints, the expected data, and the
return data.

```admonish warning "**WIP**"
Work in progress parts are marked like this. This paragraph should include a
link to the corresponding GitHub issue (if there is one), and give a brief
understanding of the feature's development status. As this is the start of the
project, no part is marked as WIP, and they are all assumed to be WIP.
