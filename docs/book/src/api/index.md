# API service

The API service is the "brain" of the project. It stores most data, like
friends, history, etc. In this chapter, you will learn about it's structure and
content.

Here is a non-exhaustive list of what the API service does :

- stores account data (personal preferences, profile picture, etc.)
- stores friend lists
- stores game history
- displays available mini-games (soon to be marketplace)
- creates lobbies
- invites to lobbies
